``
A high-quality German artificial voice that can be generated offline should be available to any project free of charge and without any licensing restrictions.

Thorsten-Voice provides german voice datasets recorded by Thorsten Müller  (male, native german  speaker) and audio optimized by Dominik Kreutz. The project also provides pretrained TTS models.

# Personal note by Thorsten Müller
`
For me, all people are equal, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion, skin color or geo-coordinates of birth. I believe in a global world where everyone is welcome everywhere and free knowledge and education is freely available to everyone. I have donated my voice to the community in the hope that it will be used in this way.
